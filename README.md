# Yugioh! Deck Builder

I built this app for people interested in Yugioh and for those that are not too familiar with it. For those user who have never heard of Yugioh, they can click on the trading card game info option. In which will display the user with a short demo and also with a short explaination of what Yugioh is all about. For those users familiar with Yugioh,they can go straight to the deck builder option. Which the user can search any card that he likes and added to the deck of his choosing. If the user wants to be more specific, there is an advance option. In the advance option, the user can search cards by type, attribute, atk,def,etc.
