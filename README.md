# Yugioh! Deck Builder
I built this app for people interested in Yugioh and for those that are not too familiar with it. For those user who have never heard of Yugioh, they can click on the trading card game info option. In which will display the user with a short demo and also with a short explaination of what Yugioh is all about. For those users familiar with Yugioh,they can go straight to the deck builder option. Which the user can search any card that he likes and added to the deck of his choosing. If the user wants to be more specific, there is an advance option. In the advance option, the user can search cards by type, attribute, atk,def,etc.\

# Tech Stack used
I built this using ReactJS because I wanted a better understanding of react usage and I knew react would render search results nicely with good performance. Also I wanted to try out the Yugioh API that I never knew existed.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
